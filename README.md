# Instagram-Clone

This project was created by Chelsia Tong and Saloni Jindal at BrainStation 2022

## Description

For an assignment, we had the idea to create a simple instagram clone within 24 hours with another student in BrainStation CS Bootcamp. Although we have little functionality, we put in a lot of effort given the short deadline of this project. Check it out!
